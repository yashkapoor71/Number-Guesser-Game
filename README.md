An interactive and fun Number Guesser Game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
You play against a computer and your score is calculated with each round. It asks the user for a number guess between 0-9 and calculates the distance of the number from the target guess. 
It does the same with the computer and then presents the winner of each round.
